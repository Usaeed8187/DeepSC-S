# Semantic Communication Systems for Speech Transmission
## Introduction
This repository contains code for the project of a deep learning enabled semantic communcation system for speech signals, named DeepSC-S. The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9450827). This project is trained with Python 3.6 under TensorFlow 1.14.0. For more code details of the SE-ResNet module, please refer [here](https://github.com/hujie-frank/SENet).
## Dataset
The dataset adopted in this project can be found in [Edinburgh DataShare](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791). Note that the original dataset version utilized in this project has been upgraded, which may results in a slight difference of the training loss.
